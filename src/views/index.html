  <h1>Shopping Cart App</h1>
  <p>
    This is a personal project made by <a href="https://github.com/crjoseabraham" class="link-text"> Jose Abraham Castillo</a> whose goal was to learn some modern topics of PHP like: MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, routing, working with sessions, namespaces, composer, a template engine called <a href="https://twig.symfony.com/" class="link-text"> Twig</a> and tie it all together with a little of modern JavaScript.
    <br><br>
    It is a basic app where you can login/register, select from a list of products and then perform a "payment" process, you can also rate items from 1 to 5 stars. 
    <br><br>
    I did this long time ago as a challenge for a job interview and now I made a complete refactor to teach myself some modern concepts, the app still has some of the rules it had for the interview: <br>
    <strong>1. You have a $100 budget every session.</strong> And <strong> 2. You can rate a product only once per session.</strong>
    <br><br>
    Please feel free to see, use, fork, critique, suggest or help in any way.
