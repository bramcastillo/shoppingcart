## Basic shopping cart with PHP & MVC

A very basic shopping cart I coded for a job interview, the code was spaghetti before so I decided to refactor it to teach myself how to apply (and work with) MVC architecture, OOP paradigm and sessions. You can test it.

# !! This is a screenshot of how it looked long time ago

As I am currently doing a complete rework of this project *I've been focusing on functionality* and understanding the principles of OOP and MVC more than UI (for the moment). *Once I'm done with the backend I'll start working on the frontend.*

This is a preview of what it looked like some time ago.
