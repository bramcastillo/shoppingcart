# Basic shopping cart with PHP & MVC

A very basic shopping cart I coded for a job interview, the code was spaghetti before so I decided to make a complete refactor in order to teach myself some modern concepts like OOP, MVC architecture, work with sessions and PDF reports.

## User accounts

There's a 'test' account stored in the database  
- User: test@gmail.com  
- Password: 123Abc

## Live demo coming soon üòÅ

I'm currently working on my personal developer's portfolio, once I'm done with it I promise I'll host this project so people can test it properly. Meanwhile, you'll have to do it the old way:  
1. git clone  
2. Import .sql file (CREATE DATABASE included)  
3. Go to localhost/shoppingcart
