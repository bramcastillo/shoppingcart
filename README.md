# [PHP/JS] Shopping cart wih rating stars system

Developed using PHP, Javascript, HTML & CSS.
This is a project I did for a job interview so it follows some of the requirements I was asked for but I changed it a bit.

● Developed using Object Oriented Programming.

● All functions work with AJAX.

● Add items to the cart or delete them.

● Process purchases with a 1000$ budget using session variables.

● Fully responsive.

● Rating stars system (you can only rate an item once per session).
